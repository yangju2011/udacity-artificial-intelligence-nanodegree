- Define a group of problems in classical PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) for the air cargo domain
- Set up the problems for search, implement action schema
- Implement a Planning Graph with automatic heuristics with mutex methods
- Compare and contrast non-heuristic search result metrics (optimality, time elapsed, number of node expansions)
- Compare and contrast heuristic search result metrics using A* with the "ignore preconditions" and "level-sum" heuristics
- Skeleton code from https://github.com/udacity/AIND-Planning
